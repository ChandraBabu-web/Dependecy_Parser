# Dependecy_Parser

#How Does Dependency Parsing Work?

Tokenization: The first step is to tokenize the input sentence into individual words or tokens.

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Each word is assigned a part-of-speech tag to indicate its grammatical category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).

Dependency Parsing: The parser analyzes the relationships between words and constructs a dependency tree. In this tree:
    Each word is represented as a node.
    Relationships between words are represented as directed edges (arcs) between nodes.
    Each arc indicates a grammatical relationship, such as subject, object, modifier, etc.

Output: The output of dependency parsing is a labeled dependency tree that captures the syntactic structure of the sentence.
